				<li>Castle Point</li>
				<li>The Castle Point in Daytime. Castle Point is a great place for the proposals.</li>
				<li>Castle Point is the highest point in Hoboken. The name is a corruption of "Castille Point", due to its supposed resemblance to the Castilian coast in Spain. To early navigators, the high serpentine crag jutting over the river reminded them of a miniature Rock of Gibraltar. The land was bought at public auction in 1804 by Col. John Stevens, who built his estate there. After his death, his son Edwin Augustus Stevens took responsibility of the estate and in 1853 built a 40-room mansion, the "Stevens Castle", on land adjacent to the point. </li>

				<li> Giovannis Pizza </li>
				<li> Giovannis Pizza is a restaurant in Hoboken and a favorite of many Stevens students.  Known for their pizza as one would expect and often compared to Bennys, Giovannis is always a reliable option for a great meal. </li>

				<li> Hudson River </li>
				<li> This iconic river of New York City, perhaps more well known for its stereotype of being polluted, the Hudson River, part of the Erie Canal, stands as the border between New Jersey and New York.  By other people, it is known as Ca-ho-ha-ta-te-a by the Iroquois and Muh-he-kun-ne-tuk by the Mohican,, it was named after the explorer Henry Hudson, and it is the largest river in the state of New York. </li>

				<li> One of seven residential halls on the Stevens campus, along with  Hayden Hall, Palmer Hall, Jonas Hall, Lore-El Center, Castle Point Hall, and Davis Hall, Humphreys is one of the two used for pre-college students, and is located near the Howe center on the upper side of campus.  Having a capacity of 150 students, and the iconic beach volleyball setup on its lawn, regardless of if one is living there, Humphrey’s Hall is a place to go.

				<li> Here is Ryan and Bradon in front of the Athletic Center </li>
				<li> Whether it be for bulking up, losing weight, or just having a fun time, the Steven’s Athletic Center can be a hot spot for student life on campus.  Features of the center include its basketball court, weights area, and pool, which can be seen from all floors.  Though pre-college kids might not be able to use it anymore, the athletic center is still an important part of the college campus. </li>

				<li> The Torch Bearer </li>
				<li> Right in the middle of campus, the torch bearer is a statue of a naked man grabbing a torch on his horse from a fallen runner and preparing to ride off.  It is surrounded by garden and is one of the more nature driven features of the university.  The statue was sculpted by American Anna Hyatt Huntington and it is the largest cast aluminum sculpture in the world, and is located next to the Samuel C. Williams Library. </li>

				<li> One of three residential halls on the Stevens campus, along with Humphreys Hall, Hayden Hall, Palmer Hall, Jonas Hall, Lore-El Center, and Castle Point Hall, Davis is one of the two open to pre-college students and located on the lower side of campus near the instructional center at the Baggio building.  Notable for its modern exterior, seen in its two step entryways and impressive looks, Davis Hall is a great option for anyone staying at Stevens. </li>

				<li> Howe Center </li>
				<li> Much like every other place at Stevens, this place has great views.  As the tallest building on Stevens, the Howe Center is home to many multipurpose areas, from dining halls to administrative buildings, and is simply a place any Stevens personnel will find themselves at at some point during the day.  It also hides Castle Point behind it. </li>
